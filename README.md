# Azure-AI---OCR-Face-Detection
Overview

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that integrates Azure Cognitive Services for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Face Detection. The application allows users to upload images, extract text using OCR, detect faces, and securely store images in Azure Blob Storage.

Key Features
OCR: Extracts text from uploaded images using Azure Computer Vision API.
Face Detection: Identifies and crops human faces in images with the Azure Face API.
Azure Blob Storage: Secure image storage and management in the cloud.
Streamlit UI: Interactive and easy-to-use interface for seamless user experience.
Real-time Processing: Asynchronous text extraction and face detection.
Technologies Used
Azure Cognitive Services (Computer Vision & Face API)
Azure Blob Storage for image storage
Python
Streamlit for web interface
PIL (Pillow) for image processing
Usage
Upload an image to the app.
Perform OCR to extract text from the image.
Detect faces and crop them from the image.
Upload images to Azure Blob Storage and manage containers.
View and manage stored images in selected containers.
This project showcases the capabilities of Azure AI for image processing, cloud storage, and real-time data handling. Perfect for building applications in document digitization, identity verification, and cloud-based image management.
